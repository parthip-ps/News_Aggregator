We are working on a News Aggregator project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This application gathers news articles from multiple sources and presents them in one place, making it easy for users to stay updated.

Our main focus is on implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. Users will be able to:

View the latest news articles
Add new articles
Edit existing articles
Delete articles they no longer need

Additionally, we are implementing user authentication to ensure that only registered users can add, edit, or delete articles. This adds a layer of security and personalization to the application.

This project helps users efficiently manage and keep track of news content, providing a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience.
